    "summary": "Context. The adoption of Machine Learning (ML)--enabled systems is steadily\nincreasing. Nevertheless, there is a shortage of ML-specific quality assurance\napproaches, possibly because of the limited knowledge of how quality-related\nconcerns emerge and evolve in ML-enabled systems. Objective. We aim to\ninvestigate the emergence and evolution of specific types of quality-related\nconcerns known as ML-specific code smells, i.e., sub-optimal implementation\nsolutions applied on ML pipelines that may significantly decrease both the\nquality and maintainability of ML-enabled systems. More specifically, we\npresent a plan to study ML-specific code smells by empirically analyzing (i)\ntheir prevalence in real ML-enabled systems, (ii) how they are introduced and\nremoved, and (iii) their survivability. Method. We will conduct an exploratory\nstudy, mining a large dataset of ML-enabled systems and analyzing over 400k\ncommits about 337 projects. We will track and inspect the introduction and\nevolution of ML smells through CodeSmile, a novel ML smell detector that we\nwill build to enable our investigation and to detect ML-specific code smells.",
