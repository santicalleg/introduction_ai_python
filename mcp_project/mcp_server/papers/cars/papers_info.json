    "summary": "We have used Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis and Monte Carlo significance\ntests to detect periodicities above the 3-sigma level in the Beta Cephei stars\nV400 Car, V401 Car, V403 Car and V405 Car. These methods produce six previously\nunreported periodicities in the expected frequency range of excited pulsations:\none in V400 Car, three in V401 Car, one in V403 Car and one in V405 Car. One of\nthese six frequencies is significant above the 4-sigma level. We provide\nstatistical significances for all of the periodicities found in these four\nstars.",

    "summary": "A large portion of the car-buying experience in the United States involves\ninteractions at a car dealership. At the dealership, the car-buyer relays their\nneeds to a sales representative. However, most car-buyers are only have an\nabstract description of the vehicle they need. Therefore, they are only able to\ndescribe their ideal car in \"car-speak\". Car-speak is abstract language that\npertains to a car's physical attributes. In this paper, we define car-speak. We\nalso aim to curate a reasonable data set of car-speak language. Finally, we\ntrain several classifiers in order to classify car-speak.",
